ProPythia
============

*ProPythia* (platform for the classification of peptides/proteins using machine and deep learning) is a Python generic modular
semi-automated platform containing functions for the classification of proteins based on their physicochemical properties
using ML and DL. ProPythia facilitates the major tasks of ML and includes modules to read and alter sequences, calculate several
types of protein descriptors, pre-process datasets, execute feature selection and dimensionality reduction, visualization
of t-SNE and UMAP, perform clustering, train and optimize ML and DL models and make predictions with different algorithms.
ProPythia has an adaptable modular architecture being a versatile and easy-to-use tool to apply ML/DL analysis over protein
sequences.

It was tested on the classification of membrane active antimicrobial peptides and enzymes, available in folder examples.
