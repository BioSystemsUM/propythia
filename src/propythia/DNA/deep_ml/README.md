# Note

There's an extra folder with all the datasets that I decided not to include in the repo because of their size. So far, it contains the following:

* human-exercise.csv -> dataset for "testing.ipynb"
* mart_export_unspliced.fa -> FASTA file with Ensembl Human Genes
* ensembl.csv -> cleaned dataset with all Ensembl Human Genes
* essential_genes.csv -> dataset with essential genes and other headers
* essential_genes_clean.csv -> positive dataset with essential genes (genes contained in at least 5 datasets)
* essential_genes_clean_total.csv -> dataset with only essential genes sequences (sequences that are in this dataset will be removed from the Ensembl dataset and form the negative dataset)
