# Note

* `testing.py` runs a combination of hyperparameters or performs hyperparameter tuning for the given model, feature mode, and data directory.
* `outputs` is a directory where the output of the hyperparameter tuning is stored. Only the filtered results with the score of each model is stored in the directory.
* `src` is a directory where the source code of the entire DL pipeline is stored.
* `essential_genes` is a directory where all the information about the essential genes is stored since it was needed a lot of data preprocessing to build the dataset.
