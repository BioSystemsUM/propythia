This is because the training function already did all of those steps using the `prepare_data` function mentioned in the introduction of this chapter's important note. However, we will need to do it again now to obtain the test set to see if the model is working properly. This is inconvenient because we are reading and splitting the data twice, but this is required because later we will use 'batch_size' (which is used to read the data) as a varying hyperparameter. Because we can only vary the hyperparameters inside the train function, we have to read the data in that function."
